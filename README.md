Car Price Prediction Model



This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting used car prices based on various features such as current price, mileage, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, owner count, and car age. The model is deployed as an interactive web application using both Streamlit and Tkinter for graphical user interface (GUI) development.

Features
Data Cleaning: The dataset used for training the model is preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and any outliers.
Machine Learning Model: XGBoost algorithm is utilized for training the model as it provides robust performance for regression tasks.
Web Application: The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input car details and receive price predictions.
GUI Interface: Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Tkinter to provide users with an alternative means of interaction with the application.
Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset using a Python script in Jupyter Notebook to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and preprocess features.
Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning model for training the data. In this project, XGBoost is chosen for its robustness and performance in regression tasks.
Model Training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships between input features and car prices.
Model Testing: Evaluate the trained model's performance using test data to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
Model Deployment: Once the model is working perfectly, download the trained model and deploy it using Streamlit for web application development.
Web Application Deployment: Use VSCode or any other suitable IDE to deploy the application on a server. Share the deployed link with users to access the prediction results.
